# Custom RAPIDS Docker Guide

This guide provides instructions for building custom RAPIDS Docker containers. This approach allows you to select only the RAPIDS libraries you need, which is ideal for creating minimal, customizable images that can be tuned to your requirements.

:::{note}
For standard installations using pre-built containers that include the full RAPIDS suite, please see the [Official RAPIDS Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.rapids.ai/install#docker).
:::

## Overview

Building a custom RAPIDS container offers several advantages over using the official pre-built images:

- **Minimal Image Sizes**: By including only the libraries you need, you can reduce the final image size.
- **Flexible Configuration**: You have full control over library versions and dependencies.
- **Development-Friendly**: You can start from a base image that matches your host environment or production requirements and the modular nature makes it easy to add additional components as required.

## Getting Started

To begin, you will need to create a few local files for your custom build: a `Dockerfile` and a configuration file (`env.yaml` for `conda` or `requirements.txt` for `pip`). The complete source for these files is provided in the "Source Files" section below for you to copy.

1. **Create a Project Directory**: It's best practice to create a dedicated folder for your custom build.

   ```bash
   mkdir rapids-custom-build && cd rapids-custom-build
   ```

2. **Prepare Your Project Files**: Based on your chosen approach (Conda or Pip), create the necessary files in your project directory by copying the code from the corresponding "Source Files" dropdown below.

3. **Customize Your Build**:
   - If using the **conda** approach, edit your local `env.yaml` file to add the desired RAPIDS libraries.
   - If using the **pip** approach, edit your local `requirements.txt` file with your desired RAPIDS libraries.

4. **Build the Image**: Use the `docker build` commands provided in the installation sections to create your custom container.

## Installation Methods

### Conda (Recommended)

The Conda approach uses the `nvidia/cuda:*-base-*` images as the base image, which are the minimal in size. This is possible because the `conda` package manager can pull and install the CUDA runtime libraries required by RAPIDS libraries in your configuration.

#### Quick Start (Conda)

After copying the source files into your local directory:

```bash
# Build the minimal base image
docker build -f rapids-conda.Dockerfile --target base -t rapids-conda-base .

# Run an interactive session
docker run --gpus all -it rapids-conda-base

# Build the Jupyter notebooks image
docker build -f rapids-conda.Dockerfile --target notebooks -t rapids-conda-notebooks .
docker run --gpus all -p 8888:8888 rapids-conda-notebooks
```

### Pip

The Pip approach requires the `nvidia/cuda:*-runtime-*` images to be used as base images. Unlike `conda`, `pip` currently does not pull in all the CUDA runtime dependencies (such as libnvrtc and libcudart), so the base image must provide the necessary CUDA runtime libraries that the RAPIDS pip wheels depend on.

#### Quick Start (Pip)

After copying the source files into your local directory:

```bash
# Build the minimal base image
docker build -f rapids-pip.Dockerfile --target base -t rapids-pip-base .

# Run an interactive session
docker run --gpus all -it rapids-pip-base

# Build the Jupyter notebooks image
docker build -f rapids-pip.Dockerfile --target notebooks -t rapids-pip-notebooks .
docker run --gpus all -p 8888:8888 rapids-pip-notebooks
```

:::{important}
When using `pip`, you must specify the CUDA version in the package name (e.g., `cudf-cu12`, `cuml-cu12`). This ensures you install the version of the library that is compatible with the CUDA toolkit.
:::

## Extending the Environment

One of the benefits of this custom build process is the ability to easily add your own packages to the environment. You can add any combination of RAPIDS and non-RAPIDS libraries to create a fully featured container for your workloads.

### Using conda

To add packages to the Conda environment, simply add them to the `dependencies` list in your `env.yaml` file.

**Example: Adding `scikit-learn` and `xgboost` to a conda image containing `cudf`**

```yaml
name: rapids-env
channels:
  - rapidsai-nightly
  - conda-forge
  - nvidia
dependencies:
  - cudf=25.08
  - scikit-learn
  - xgboost
```

### Using pip

To add packages to the Pip environment, add them to your `requirements.txt` file.

**Example: Adding `scikit-learn` and `lightgbm` to a pip image containing `cudf`**

```txt
cudf-cu12==25.08.*
scikit-learn
lightgbm
```

After modifying your configuration file, simply rebuild the Docker image. The new packages will be automatically included in your custom RAPIDS environment.

## Build Customization

You can customize the build by passing arguments to the `docker build` command. This is useful for targeting different versions of CUDA, Python, or Linux distributions.

### Available Build Arguments

| Argument           | Default Value | Description                                            | Example Values       |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `CUDA_VER`         | `12.9.1`      | Sets the CUDA version for the base image and packages. | `12.0`               |
| `PYTHON_VER`       | `3.12`        | Defines the Python version to install and use.         | `3.11`, `3.10`       |
| `LINUX_DISTRO`     | `ubuntu`      | The base Linux distribution.                           | `rockylinux9`, `cm2` |
| `LINUX_DISTRO_VER` | `24.04`       | The version of the Linux distribution.                 | `20.04`, `24.04`     |

### Build Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to use the build arguments. These commands can be adapted for both the Conda and Pip Dockerfiles.

#### Customize Python Version

```bash
# Build with Python 3.11
docker build -f rapids-conda.Dockerfile --target base \
  --build-arg PYTHON_VER=3.11 \
  -t rapids-custom:py311
```

#### Customize Linux Distribution Version

```bash
# Build on Ubuntu 22.04
docker build -f rapids-conda.Dockerfile --target base \
  --build-arg LINUX_DISTRO_VER=22.04 \
  -t rapids-custom:ubuntu2404
```

#### Combine Multiple Customizations

```bash
# Build for CUDA 12.9.1, Python 3.11, and Ubuntu 22.04
docker build -f rapids-conda.Dockerfile --target base \
  --build-arg CUDA_VER=12.9.1 \
  --build-arg PYTHON_VER=3.11 \
  --build-arg LINUX_DISTRO_VER=22.04 \
  -t rapids-custom:custom-build
```

## Available Image Targets

Both the Conda and Pip Dockerfiles are multi-stage and can produce two different images:

- **Base Image** (`--target base`): A minimal environment with Python, IPython, and your selected RAPIDS libraries. Ideal for scripting and headless operation.
- **Notebooks Image** (`--target notebooks`): Extends the base image with JupyterLab and GPU-monitoring extensions. Perfect for interactive data science and exploration.

## Verifying Your Installation

After building your image, you can quickly test that RAPIDS is installed and running correctly. The base images are designed to launch directly into an interactive `ipython` shell, which is the easiest way to verify your custom environment.

1. **Run the Container Interactively**

   This command starts your container and drops you directly into an `ipython` session.

   ```bash
   # For Conda builds
   docker run --gpus all -it rapids-conda-base

   # For Pip builds
   docker run --gpus all -it rapids-pip-base
   ```

2. **Test RAPIDS within IPython**

   Once you are inside the `ipython` shell, you can import and use the RAPIDS libraries you installed.

   ```python
   # You will see an In [1]: prompt. Type the following:
   import cudf

   print(f"cuDF version: {cudf.__version__}")

   # Create a simple GPU DataFrame to confirm everything works
   gdf = cudf.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2, 3]})
   print("\nRAPIDS is working correctly!")
   print(gdf)
   ```

3. **Expected Output**

   If your installation is successful, you will see output similar to this, confirming the cuDF version and displaying a GPU-accelerated DataFrame:

   ```python
   In [1]: import cudf
      ...: print(f"cuDF version: {cudf.__version__}")
      ...: gdf = cudf.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2, 3]})
      ...: print("\nRAPIDS is working correctly!")
      ...: print(gdf)
      ...:
   cuDF version: 25.08.00

   RAPIDS is working correctly!
      a
   0  1
   1  2
   2  3

   In [2]:
   ```
